*You are a creature of the rivers and oceans*

:white_circle: **drying**
*If youre above water your wetness level will lower slowly, 
 once its at 0 you will start taking damage.
To refill this just go into the water again to regenerate it.
If you however wish to regain wetness, you can eat seagrass or kelp.
Watch out tho because when you eat it you become more and more 
 swollen, and at level 7 you cant eat it anymore.
To regain this ability just go into the water and it will regenerate.*

:green_circle: **Mmmmm water**
*You can breathe and see perfectly underwater.*
:green_circle: **Water boost**
*You can boost yourself while submerged in water.*
:green_circle: **Rainy swim**
*While exposed to rain, you are able to swim anywhere.*
:yellow_circle: **Small body**
*You are much smaller than usual, this is to avoid
 being caught by fishing rods and fishing nets.
This also makes you be able to get put inside a bucket by
 being punched by someone holding a waterbucket.
Use your secondary while in a bucket to hop out.

**1** *Open the datapack folder*
*(You should see the bucket folder)*
**2** *Now, move the bucket folder out of the riverling folder**
